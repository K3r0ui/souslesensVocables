Reservoir Engineering;RESERVOIR;"Reservoir Data domain lead by a one Data Domain Owner, is made up 2 sub domains driven by a specific data domain lead.
Reservoir Data are mainly produced by GIS entities to serve reservoir modeling or management";Reservoir Engineering;
Geology;2G STUDIES;"All data from studies produced during exploration, appraisal and development phases that involve Geologists and geophysicists experts
Mostly semi structured data like power point presentations from previous studies or bought studies";Geology;
Geophysics;GEOPHYSICAL DATA;Geophysical data like seismic acquisition follow a mature workflow mainly operates by well identified actors like MTG. These data have a quite good traceability because they works as Client/supplier relationship and host data into corporate data base managed by IGR like Seislink;Geophysics;
