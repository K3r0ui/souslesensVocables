An excessive level of deviation, between the site and predicted value, enhances a warning detection anticipating a possible catastrophic outcome.

The parameters monitored with SmartSignal are taken from PI, so the project includes assistance for data collection of all required sensors from rotating machinery packages. It also provides real-time calculation of performance indicators of equipments with PI-Asset Framework which are also monitored with Smart Signal.

Saphir [KAPPA WORKSTATION]	Angola	"Saphir offers a unique combination of analysis tools, analytical models and numerical models which can connect to other dynamic data application such as Topaze for Rate Transient Analysis and Rubis for fullfield history matching.

Pressure Transient Analysis, or PTA, is, in most cases, about analyzing high frequency, high resolution shut-in data. The data are captured during dedicated well test operations such as DSTs or production tests or during routine operational shut-ins by Permanent Downhole Gauges (PDG). The pressure response from these shut-ins can be used to provide information about the reservoir within the radius of investigation for radial flow or the area of investigation for more complex geometries. The diagnostic plot of choice is the loglog plot where the pressure and the Bourdet derivative allow the identification of reservoir geometry and properties, these are then matched with models. Specific operations require specific processing, such as multirate gas tests, interference tests, multilayer tests, etc. The development of deconvolution allows to combine several of these shut-ins in time to provide information much deeper into the reservoir than would normally be feasible by a shut-in alone."
